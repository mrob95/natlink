This depository is  currently for updating and documenting the old natlink-svn  repository.

You will find the C++ COM interface that actually talks to Dragon in the ``NatlinkSource`` folder.
 The Python interface that is actually used  and extended abundant by many other applications resides in the ``MacroSystem``  folder.
